## 0.0.5 - @m00nyONE
- ZoS will limit the mapPing API in U45 - this addon should no longer be used for creating new projects and all existing projects should migrate to LibGroupBroadcast by @sirinister when it's released. Don't worry, this does not mean the end of data sharing! ZoS introduced a new dedicated sharing api for addons in U45. This Library will still work, but only every 10s instead of every 2s.
- automatically change PING_RATE to every 10s after U45
