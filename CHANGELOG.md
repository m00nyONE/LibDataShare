## 2024.02.10 - @m00nyONE
- introducing compatibility layer to LibGroupBroadcast
- fix handler bleeding to global

## 0.0.6 - @m00nyONE
- adjust PING_RATE for U46 because ZoS extended the time before limiting the MapPingAPI until U46 launches.
- addon will now disable itself on U46 except on PTS -- So Addon devs still have a chance to do a last minute patch of their addons if they missed it.

## 0.0.5 - @m00nyONE
- ZoS will limit the mapPing API in U46 - this addon should no longer be used for creating new projects and all existing projects should migrate to LibGroupBroadcast by @sirinister when it's released. Don't worry, this does not mean the end of data sharing! ZoS introduced a new dedicated sharing api for addons in U45. This Library will still work, but only every 10s instead of every 2s.
- automatically change PING_RATE to every 10s after U45
